cleanup.py - Template file cleanup utilities.

This module provides functions to remove template-specific files from projects
created from pyproject-template. Users can choose to:
1. Remove setup files only (keep update checking capability)
2. Remove all template files (no future update checking)

Usage:
    from cleanup import cleanup_template_files, CleanupMode

    # Remove setup files only
    cleanup_template_files(CleanupMode.SETUP_ONLY)

    # Remove all template files
    cleanup_template_files(CleanupMode.ALL)

    # Preview what would be deleted
    cleanup_template_files(CleanupMode.SETUP_ONLY, dry_run=True)

    """Remove user-visible stale references to template-only machinery.

    Applies targeted regex rewrites to five files that retain documentation
    or configuration for template-only tooling after the cleanup phase has
    deleted the files those references point at:

    * ``pyproject.toml`` — removes every ``tools/pyproject_template/``
      artifact: the ruff ``per-file-ignores`` block, the mypy ``exclude``
      entry (and its explanatory comment), and the mypy override (in both
      stanza and inline-array form, because ``doit fmt_pyproject`` rewrites
      the file before cleanup runs in the wizard).
    * ``README.md`` — removes the ``## Quick Setup (Automated)`` and
      ``## Using This Template (Manual)`` top-level sections plus the
      ``### Migrating an Existing Project`` and ``### Keeping Up to Date``
      subsections of ``## Versioning & Releases``.
    * ``docs/development/doit-tasks-reference.md`` — removes the
      ``### template_clean`` section and rewrites the TOC table row so the
      remaining ``cleanup`` entry is listed alone.
    * ``docs/development/github-repository-settings.md`` — strips the
      broken-link sentence in the intro paragraph that points at
      ``tools/pyproject_template/repo_settings.py``, and removes the
      ``Security Settings`` introductory paragraph that names
      ``_configure_security_settings()`` in the same deleted module.
    * ``docs/development/release-and-automation.md`` — rewrites the
      "New projects (bootstrap flow)" paragraph so the broken link to
      ``tools/pyproject_template/configure.py`` is gone but the user-facing
      "push the v0.0.0 tag when ready" instruction (and its trailing
      ``git push origin v0.0.0`` code block) survives untouched.

    Patterns are applied blindly; ``re.sub`` is a no-op when nothing matches,
    and the function detects whether a file changed by comparing final
    content to the original. That makes the scrubber idempotent — repeat
    calls and already-scrubbed files record no change.

    Companion helpers in this module handle the cases where a regex per file
    is the wrong tool: :func:`regenerate_doc_toc` rebuilds
    ``docs/TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md`` from the surviving ``docs/`` tree (so all
    broken ``template/*.md`` links drop out in one pass), and
    :func:`check_stale_template_references` performs a warn-only post-cleanup
    sweep that surfaces any future regression of this bug class.

    Args:
        root: Project root directory (defaults to cwd).
        dry_run: If True, report what would be changed but do not write files.

    A warn-only post-cleanup sweep. Surfaces any future regression of the

    manual grep. Catches arbitrary docs files, not just the targets handled
    explicitly by :func:`scrub_template_references`.

    The marker list (:data:`_STALE_TEMPLATE_MARKERS`) is conservative — every

    deletes its target.

        Empty list when no stale references are found. The caller decides
