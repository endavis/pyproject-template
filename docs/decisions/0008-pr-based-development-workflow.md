# ADR-0008: PR-based development workflow

## Status

Accepted

## Decision

Adopt a PR-based workflow: Issue → Branch → Commit → PR → Merge. Never commit directly to main. Branch names must follow `<type>/<issue>-<description>` convention. Merge commits must include PR and issue references.

## Rationale

Provides clear audit trail linking issues to PRs to commits, enables code review on every change, ensures CI runs before merge, and makes changes easy to revert (single squash commit per PR). Works well with AI agents due to structured, predictable process.
