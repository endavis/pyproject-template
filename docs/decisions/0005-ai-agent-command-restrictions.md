# ADR-0005: AI agent command restrictions via hooks

## Status

Accepted

## Decision

Implement tool-level enforcement that blocks dangerous commands (like `--force`, `--admin`, `--no-verify`) before execution via Claude Code PreToolUse hooks, Gemini CLI BeforeTool hooks, and Codex CLI approval policies.

## Rationale

Documentation alone is insufficient - AI agents may violate rules after context compaction or when trying to "help quickly". A real incident occurred where an AI agent attempted to bypass branch protection. Tool-level blocking provides defense in depth, applying restrictions regardless of agent context state.
