# ADR-9011: Use pytest for testing

## Status

Accepted

## Decision

Use **pytest** as the testing framework with pytest-xdist for parallel execution and pytest-cov for coverage reporting.

## Rationale

pytest minimizes boilerplate (plain functions, no classes required), has a powerful fixture system, excellent assertion introspection, and is the industry standard for Python testing. Parallel execution via xdist speeds up CI significantly.
