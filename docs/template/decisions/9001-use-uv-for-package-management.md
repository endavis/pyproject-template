# ADR-9001: Use uv for package management

## Status

Accepted

## Decision

Use **uv** as the primary package manager for dependency management, virtual environment creation, and package installation.

## Rationale

uv is a modern Python package manager written in Rust by Astral (creators of ruff). It provides 10-100x faster dependency resolution and installation than pip, built-in virtual environment management, and compatibility with `pyproject.toml` standards. Using the same maintainers as ruff ensures aligned tooling philosophy across the project.
