# ADR-9004: Auto-discover doit tasks from modules

## Status

Accepted

## Decision

Implement automatic task discovery that scans `tools/doit/` modules and imports all `task_*` functions automatically, rather than requiring manual imports in `dodo.py`.

## Rationale

Manual imports were error-prone - developers would forget to add imports for new tasks, and the import blocks grew unwieldy. Auto-discovery means new tasks are automatically available without editing `dodo.py`, eliminating "forgot to import" errors and keeping `dodo.py` minimal (3 lines instead of 50+).
