# Perf Change

Change performance-sensitive code with a measured baseline, a profile, and a pasted comparison —
never a speedup claimed from reading the code.

Argument: `$ARGUMENTS` — the function or path to make faster, and why (what's slow, or where it came
from: a profile, a user report, a benchmark trend). If it is empty, ask the user what needs to be
faster and why before doing anything else.

This project ships `tests/benchmarks/`, `doit benchmark`, `doit benchmark_save`, `doit
benchmark_compare`, and a benchmark-tracking CI workflow — none of it measures anything unless you run
it, in the order that keeps a claimed speedup honest. `.claude/rules/verified-claims.md` exists to stop
exactly the failure this command is for: an agent reporting a speedup it never measured.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Confirm a benchmark covers the change

Look in `tests/benchmarks/` for a benchmark that already exercises the function or path you are about
to change.

**If `tests/benchmarks/` has no benchmark for the path being changed, write one before optimizing it.**
Follow the pattern in `tests/benchmarks/test_bench_core.py`:

```python
@pytest.mark.benchmark
def test_bench_<name>(benchmark: Any) -> None:
    """Benchmark <target> with <case>."""
    benchmark(<callable>, *args)
```

New benchmark files belong in `tests/benchmarks/`. Benchmarks are marked `benchmark` and disabled by
default (`--benchmark-disable` in `pyproject.toml`'s `addopts`; see `tests/benchmarks/conftest.py`),
and `tests/test_mutmut_config.py` leaves that directory out of mutation testing on purpose — they time
the package and assert nothing, so they cannot kill a mutant.

Run `doit benchmark` once to confirm the benchmark collects and passes before you rely on it.

### Step 2: Baseline

Before changing anything:

```bash
doit benchmark_save
```

This saves a numbered run under `tmp/benchmarks/` — see `tools/doit/benchmark.py` for the exact
command. `doit benchmark_compare` always diffs against the most recently saved run, so do this
immediately before your change: the newest file has to be the baseline, not something left over from
an earlier session.

### Step 3: Profile

Find out where the time actually goes, with the standard library's `cProfile`, and read the sorted
output with `pstats`:

```bash
mkdir -p tmp/agents/claude
uv run python -m cProfile -o tmp/agents/claude/perf-<n>-profile.stats \
  -m pytest tests/benchmarks/<file>.py --benchmark-enable --benchmark-only -q -p no:randomly
uv run python -c "import pstats; pstats.Stats('tmp/agents/claude/perf-<n>-profile.stats').sort_stats('tottime').print_stats(20)"
rm tmp/agents/claude/perf-<n>-profile.stats
```

Sort by `tottime` (self time), not `cumulative`: cumulative is dominated by pytest's own call stack
(`pluggy`, `_pytest.main`), since the profiler wraps the whole test process, not just the function
under test. `tottime` surfaces the module's own lines.

### Step 4: Change

Make the change Step 3 pointed at. Keep the observable behavior identical — same inputs, same
outputs. A correctness fix found while profiling belongs in its own PR, not folded into this one,
unless it is the bug that made the code slow.

### Step 5: Compare

```bash
doit benchmark_compare
```

Read the printed "Comparing against benchmarks from: ..." line and confirm it names the baseline you
took in Step 2. Paste the whole table into the PR description. **No speedup figure without it.**

If the change made things slower, or no measurable difference, that is the answer — report it, don't
rerun until the number looks better.

### Step 6: Validate and record

```bash
doit check
```

**`doit check` must pass; a faster wrong answer is a regression.** Never edit a test to make it pass.
Stop and report the failure instead.

Carry the comparison table, what Step 3 found, and what Step 4 changed into the PR description; a
reviewer should not have to re-run the benchmark to see whether the change helped. When the task is
done, hand off to `/ghi-finalize`.

## Notes

- Runs are noisy on shared hardware. Run `uv run pytest --help` and check the current
  `--benchmark-min-rounds` and `--benchmark-warmup` defaults before tuning either one.
  `[tool.pytest-benchmark]` in `pyproject.toml` is not one of its sources — the installed plugin
  reads only command-line flags, never that table (#879). If a comparison looks noisy, rerun `doit
  benchmark_compare` first; for tighter control, run the pytest command from `tools/doit/benchmark.py`
  directly with `--benchmark-min-rounds=<N>` or `--benchmark-warmup=on` appended, since the doit
  tasks themselves take no extra flags.
- CI tracks benchmark history separately (`docs/development/ci-cd-testing.md`, "Benchmark Tracking"),
  but only from pushes to `main` (`.github/workflows/benchmark.yml`'s `store` job is gated on
  `github.event_name == 'push'`). A PR gets no benchmark comparison from CI, so this command's local
  table is the only before/after number the PR carries.
- Write scratch files to `tmp/agents/claude/` with the issue number in the name, and delete them when
  the task is done.
