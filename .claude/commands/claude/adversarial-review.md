# Adversarial Review (Claude)

Run a steerable adversarial review using Claude — pressure-tests design choices, assumptions, and alternative approaches. Optional focus: $ARGUMENTS.

## Instructions

This command runs in the main conversation context. Claude performs the adversarial review directly — no external CLI invocation needed.

### Step 1: Gather review context

1. Check what changed:
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff
   git log main..HEAD --oneline
   ```
2. Read project standards:
   - Read `AGENTS.md`
   - Check for relevant ADRs in `docs/decisions/`

### Step 2: Challenge the changes

Be skeptical and steerable. Pressure-test:

- **Direction Critique:** Was this the right approach? Is the design sound? Would a different architecture be safer or simpler?
- **Hidden Assumptions:** What implicit constraints does this code depend on? What breaks if those assumptions don't hold?
- **Failure Modes:** What are the auth, data loss, race condition, rollback, and reliability failure modes? What happens at scale or under adversarial input?
- **Alternatives Worth Considering:** What other approaches exist? Are there simpler paths that achieve the same goal with less risk or complexity?

Focus area (optional): $ARGUMENTS

### Step 3: Present findings

Format the adversarial review as:

```markdown
## Adversarial Review

### Direction Critique
- (Was this the right approach? Are there design-level concerns?)

### Hidden Assumptions
- (What must be true for this code to work correctly?)

### Failure Modes
- (What breaks under stress, adversarial input, or at scale?)

### Alternatives Worth Considering
- (Simpler or safer paths that might achieve the same goal)

*Adversarial Review by: Claude* | *Date: <today's date>*
```

This is a *challenge* — the user decides whether to accept, defer, or push back on each finding.

### Step 4: Ask about posting

If a PR exists for the current branch, ask the user:

```bash
gh pr view --json number,headRefName 2>/dev/null
```

"Would you like to post this adversarial review as a PR comment? (yes / no)"

If yes:
```bash
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "<adversarial review>"
```
