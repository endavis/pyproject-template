# Implement Issue

Implement the plan for GitHub issue #$ARGUMENTS.

## Instructions

You MUST delegate the implementation to an agent (Task tool) to keep the main conversation context clean. The agent does all the coding. You receive the summary for user review.

### Step 1: Validate preconditions

1. **Verify the issue exists and is open:**
   ```bash
   gh issue view $ARGUMENTS --json number,title,state,labels
   ```
   - If the issue does not exist or is closed, tell the user and stop.

2. **Verify a plan comment exists:**
   Fetch all comments and search for the plan header:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/$ARGUMENTS/comments --jq '.[].body' | grep "## Implementation Plan for"
   ```
   - If no plan comment is found, tell the user:
     > "No implementation plan found for issue #$ARGUMENTS. Run `/plan-issue $ARGUMENTS` first."
   - Stop and wait for the user.

3. **Check current branch state:**
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   git status --short
   ```
   - If already on a branch matching `*/$ARGUMENTS-*` (e.g., `feat/$ARGUMENTS-description`):
     - Tell the user you're resuming work on the existing branch
     - Skip branch creation (Step 2)
     - If there are uncommitted changes, warn the user and ask how to proceed
   - If on `main` or a different branch: proceed to Step 2

### Step 2: Create the branch

Only if not already on the correct branch:

1. Fetch the issue to determine the branch type:
   ```bash
   gh issue view $ARGUMENTS --json title,labels
   ```
2. Determine branch type from labels:
   - `enhancement` → `feat`
   - `bug` → `fix`
   - `refactor` → `refactor`
   - `documentation` → `docs`
   - `chore` → `chore`
   - Default → `issue`
3. Create and switch to branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   git checkout -b <type>/$ARGUMENTS-<short-description>
   ```

### Step 3: Spawn an implementation agent

Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` and provide it with the issue number and branch name. The agent should:

1. **Read the project rules:**
   - Read `AGENTS.md` — understand workflow, conventions, code style, testing guidelines
   - Read `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — understand TodoWrite requirements

2. **Fetch the implementation plan:**
   Retrieve all comments and find the one containing `## Implementation Plan for`:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/$ARGUMENTS/comments --jq '.[] | select(.body | contains("## Implementation Plan for")) | .body'
   ```
   - If multiple plan comments exist, use the most recent one
   - Parse the plan to extract the file list and test plan

3. **Implement the plan:**
   - Follow the plan step by step
   - Create implementation files
   - Create test files — this is MANDATORY, never skip tests
   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions

4. **Run validation:**
   - Run: `doit check`
   - If checks fail, fix the issues and re-run
   - Do NOT give up after first failure — investigate and fix

5. **Return a summary** of all changes made:
   - Files created/modified with brief descriptions
   - Test results (pass/fail counts)
   - Any deviations from the plan and why

### Step 4: Present changes to user

After the agent returns, show the user:
- Summary of what was implemented
- Files changed
- Test results
- Any issues or deviations from the plan

Tell the user:
- Review the changes and test as needed
- Discuss any fixes directly in conversation (no command needed)
- When satisfied, use `/finalize` to commit and create a PR
