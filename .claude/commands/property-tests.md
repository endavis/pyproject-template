# Property Tests

Write a Hypothesis property test for a function or module: a property named up front, a strategy
built from types, and proof -- against deliberately broken code -- that the test can actually fail.

Argument: `$ARGUMENTS` -- the function or module to test, optionally followed by what property to
check. If it is empty, ask the user what it should cover before doing anything else.

A property test that only checks a call does not raise, or that restates the implementation under a
different name, passes forever and finds nothing. This command keeps the judgment calls that prevent
that explicit, instead of leaving them to be skipped under deadline pressure.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Pick the property

State which of these the test asserts, in one sentence, before writing any code:

- **Round-trip** -- `decode(encode(x)) == x`.
- **Idempotence** -- `f(f(x)) == f(x)`.
- **Invariant** -- a relationship every output must satisfy, whatever the input.
- **Oracle** -- the result agrees with a simpler reference implementation.

**If none of these fit, stop: an example-based test is the better tool.** A property with no name
attached is usually a check that the function runs without raising, which is a different, much
weaker claim.

### Step 2: Build the strategy

Build the input from what it is, not from what to reject: `st.builds`, `st.from_type`, or
`@st.composite` for a shape none of those infer directly. Reach for `assume()` or `.filter()` only
once the type-first strategy does not fit -- both discard whatever generated example does not match,
and enough rejections trip Hypothesis's own `HealthCheck.filter_too_much` rather than widen the
strategy to cover the case.

### Step 3: Write the test

Mark it `@pytest.mark.property` -- the marker `pyproject.toml` registers under
`[tool.pytest.ini_options]`. Put it next to any existing property tests for the module it covers;
this template's own `tests/template/test_properties.py` is a worked example, asserting properties of
the skeleton's `greet` function.

**Leave `deadline` and `max_examples` to the `ci` and `default` profiles in `tests/conftest.py`.** Do
not add a per-test `@settings(...)` for either. CI loads the `ci` profile -- `ci.yml` and, since #877,
`mutation.yml` both set `HYPOTHESIS_PROFILE=ci` -- which drops the deadline entirely, because
per-example wall-clock time on a shared runner measures the runner's warmup, not the property under
test (#736). A per-test override fights that profile instead of relying on it.

**A new test file that imports the package needs one more edit.**

See the "### Which Tests Run" section of `docs/development/ci-cd-testing.md`: `mutmut` runs a fixed
test selection (`pytest_add_cli_args_test_selection` in `[tool.mutmut]`), and a test file that imports
the package but is missing from that list never runs against a mutant --
`tests/test_mutmut_config.py::test_every_test_of_the_package_is_selected` fails until it is added.
Adding tests to a file already in that list needs no change.

### Step 4: Prove it can fail

Break the code under test on purpose -- invert a comparison, drop a branch, whatever makes the named
property false -- and run the test. **Confirm the property fails, read what Hypothesis reports, then
undo the deliberate break, not the file's other changes.** Hypothesis reports a `Failing test case:`
block, one generated keyword argument per line -- read what the installed version actually prints
rather than assuming its shape.

Reverse the specific edit that broke the code, then run `git diff <file>` to confirm only the intended
work remains -- no trace of the deliberate break, and nothing else missing either. The code under test
usually already carries the task's own uncommitted changes, such as the new function the property
covers. **Use `git checkout -- <file>` only when the file had no other uncommitted changes before this
step** -- it discards the whole file, the deliberate break along with any real work alongside it.

A test that nobody has watched fail is a test that might not be testing anything.

### Step 5: Pin the counterexample

Step 4 is a drill against code broken on purpose -- there is no bug there to pin. The case this step
covers is different: at any point while a property test runs against the *real* code, Hypothesis may
report a genuine failing input. That is a bug. **Fix the code first.**

Then add the input from the report as `@example(...)` immediately above `@given(...)`, using the same
keyword arguments `@given` takes -- skip `self` if the test is a method, it isn't a parameter
`@example` accepts. Hypothesis also saves a failing input in a local example database
(`.hypothesis/examples/`, gitignored) and retries it first on the next run -- but only on the machine
and checkout that found it. Pinning it as `@example(...)` makes every run check it: a fresh clone, a
teammate's machine, or CI, none of which ever see that local database.

### Step 6: Validate

```bash
uv run pytest -m property <path>
doit check
```

Run the scoped property tests first for fast feedback, then `doit check` before finishing. Stop at the
first failure and report it. Never edit a test to make it pass.

## Notes

- Write scratch files to `tmp/agents/claude/` with the issue number in the name, and delete them when
  the task is done.
