"""The secret-pattern list must exist once, and be enforced where it can be.

Only Codex has a native environment allowlist (`[shell_environment_policy]`).
Claude, Copilot and Antigravity have no equivalent setting — verified against
each CLI, see `docs/development/ai/command-blocking.md` (#682).

That leaves two enforcement points, and they must not drift:

* `.codex/config.toml` removes secret-shaped variables from the child
  environment outright.
* The shared PreToolUse hook — the only control that reaches all four agents —
  blocks environment dumps and credential-store reads.

`SECRET_ENV_PATTERNS` in the hook is the single source of truth; these tests
hold the Codex config to it.
