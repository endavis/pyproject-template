"""Contract tests for per-stack rule files.

Rule files are mirrored across every agent rule surface this project wires,
because every agent in the delegation matrix edits this codebase. The checklist body must stay
identical everywhere: a rule that disagrees with itself across agents is worse
than no rule, because whichever agent is driving decides which version applies.

These tests also enforce the authoring discipline from
``.claude/rules/README.md`` — the 30-line cap and the mandatory
``Observed failures:`` footer, which is what separates a rule derived from real
defects from a generic best-practices checklist.
