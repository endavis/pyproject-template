"""Instruction pointers must resolve to something that exists.

`.claude/CLAUDE.md` told every Claude session, in blocks marked MANDATORY and
ending "NO EXCEPTIONS", to find two `AGENTS.md` sections that were not there and
to run a command that did not exist (#738). Authoritative framing plus no
destination is the documentation form of a control that reports success while
doing nothing.

Three pointer shapes are checked:

1. Quoted section references — ``Read <file> and locate the "## Section" section``.
2. Markdown link anchors — ``[text](path.md#anchor)``. `test_markdown_links.py`
   splits the fragment off before resolving, so it validates the file and never
   the section; this closes that half.
3. Parenthesized section names — `` `path.md` (Section) ``, the form of
   `AGENTS.md`'s Pre-Action Checks table. One of its rows sent every agent to a
   CONTRIBUTING.md section that did not exist (#828).

Anchors were all resolving when this was written. The check is preventive, and
`test_anchor_checker_detects_a_broken_anchor` keeps it from passing merely because
it looks at nothing. `test_section_name_checker_detects_a_broken_pointer` does the
same for the third shape.
