"""The two `security-triage` bodies must agree, and neither may silence a finding for free.

`doit check` runs both scanners unconditionally (`task_check` in `tools/doit/quality.py`), so a
bandit or pip-audit finding blocks an agent mid-task. The shortest way past one is a suppression:
bandit takes a bare `# nosec` that silences every test on the line, or a `[tool.bandit] skips` entry
that disables a test repository-wide; pip-audit findings have no sanctioned way through `doit audit`
at all. Without a skill, the fastest path for an agent under pressure to get to green is exactly the
one that checks nothing (#834).

Two surfaces carry it -- `.claude/commands/` for Claude, `.agents/skills/` for Codex, Antigravity
and Copilot -- and whichever agent the user drives decides which body applies. A step present in
one and missing from the other is a control that fires for some users and not others. The bodies
are deliberately not byte-identical, since invocation syntax differs per host, so what is asserted
is the contract and its ordering.

Scoped to the agents a project actually wires, per `tests/agent_roster.py` (#690).
