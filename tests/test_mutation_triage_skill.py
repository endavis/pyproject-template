"""The two `mutation-triage` bodies must agree, and neither may pin the mutation over behavior.

Both `doit mutate` and `doit coverage` are informational about the gap this skill closes: a
surviving mutant does not fail `doit mutate`, locally or in the weekly workflow, and a line
`doit coverage` marks ``Missing`` does not fail `doit check` unless it drags the total under
`fail_under`. Nothing stops a survivor being declared equivalent with no reason, or "killed" by
a test that pins the mutated literal instead of real behavior -- both look like progress and
prove nothing (#830).

Two surfaces carry the workflow -- `.claude/commands/` for Claude, `.agents/skills/` for Codex,
Antigravity and Copilot -- and whichever agent the user drives decides which body applies. A
step, or a gate sentence, present in one and missing from the other is a control that fires for
some users and not others. The bodies are deliberately not byte-identical, since invocation
syntax differs per host, so what is asserted is the contract and its ordering -- the same
approach `test_add_dependency_skill.py` takes for `add-dependency` (#829).

Scoped to the agents a project actually wires, per `tests/agent_roster.py` (#690).
