"""Validate the cross-agent delegation matrix file layout.

Static test only — no CLI or model invocations. Verifies that:

- Every source x target x action command/skill cell resolves to a file at the
  documented path (Codex and Antigravity share the host-agnostic
  `.agents/skills/delegate-*` files, so distinct files number fewer than cells).
- The matrix documentation page exists.

The matrix is sized from the agents this project wires, not from the template's
own four. In the template that is 48 cells over 40 distinct files; a project that
keeps one agent has no cross-agent matrix and checks nothing here, rather than
failing 37 cells for agents it deliberately dropped (#690).

See `docs/development/ai/cross-agent-delegation.md` and issues #550, #640.
