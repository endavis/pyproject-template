"""Validate the cross-agent delegation matrix file layout.

Static test only — no CLI or model invocations. Verifies that:

- All 48 source x target x action command/skill files exist at the documented paths.
- `.gemini/settings.json` `skills.disabled` contains all 12 Codex-source delegation
  skill names (preventing Gemini from loading them).
- The matrix documentation page exists.

See `docs/development/ai/cross-agent-delegation.md` and issue #550.
