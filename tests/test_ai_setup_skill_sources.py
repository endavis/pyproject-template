"""`AI_SETUP.md` must not credit `.agents/skills/` with a command it lacks (#869).

It said, twice, that `/ghi-status` came from `.agents/skills/`, which has no
`ghi-status` skill. Copilot reads `/ghi-status` from
`.claude/commands/ghi-status.md` instead, as `.copilot/README.md` says. These
tests hold every command the doc credits to `.agents/skills/` to a skill there.
