"""The walkthrough's worktree section relies on what `/claude:implement` does (#866).

It tells the reader to create the issue's branch in a worktree before step 4,
because `/claude:implement` skips branch creation, and with it
`git checkout main`, when the current branch already belongs to the issue. If
the command stops doing that, the walkthrough sends readers into a failing
checkout, so these tests hold the two files together.
