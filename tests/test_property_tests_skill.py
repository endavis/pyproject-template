"""The two `property-tests` bodies must agree on when and how to write one.

Hypothesis is already installed and configured -- the `ci` and `default` profiles in
`tests/conftest.py`, and the `property` marker in `pyproject.toml` -- but nothing guided
the judgment call that makes a property test worth having: which property, built from
what strategy, proven able to fail, with its counterexample pinned (#831). A property
that only checks a call does not raise, or that restates the implementation under a
different name, passes forever and finds nothing.

Two surfaces carry it -- `.claude/commands/` for Claude, `.agents/skills/` for
Codex, Antigravity and Copilot -- and whichever agent the user drives decides
which body applies. A step present in one and missing from the other is a
control that fires for some users and not others. The bodies are deliberately
not byte-identical, since invocation syntax differs per host, so what is
asserted is the contract and its ordering.

Scoped to the agents a project actually wires, per `tests/agent_roster.py`
(#690).
