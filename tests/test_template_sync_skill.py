"""The two `template-sync` bodies must agree on the steps that carry the risk.

`template-sync` ships on two surfaces — `.claude/commands/template-sync.md` for
Claude, `.agents/skills/template-sync/SKILL.md` for Codex, Antigravity and
Copilot. Whichever agent the user happens to be driving decides which body
applies, so a step present in one and missing from the other is not a
documentation inconsistency; it is a control that fires for some users and not
others. `.claude/rules/README.md` makes the same argument for rule files.

Unlike rule files, these two bodies are not byte-identical and should not be:
the invocation syntax differs per host (`/ghi-finalize` against the
`ghi-finalize` skill), and each host names itself. What must agree is the
contract — the ordering constraint and the guards whose absence produces a
wrong sync.

Scoped to the agents a project actually wires, per `tests/agent_roster.py`
(#690).
