"""The two `python-version-bump` bodies must agree, and both must gate the floor raise (#833).

The supported Python range is declared in seven places (`tests/test_python_versions_agree.py`
is the check that they agree). Bumping the newest version is safe to automate; raising the floor
drops users on the old version, which only the user may decide. A skill that changes the seven
settings without asking, or that a user drives on one host but not another, makes that call for
them silently on whichever surface skipped the gate.

Two surfaces carry it -- `.claude/commands/` for Claude, `.agents/skills/` for Codex, Antigravity
and Copilot -- and whichever agent the user drives decides which body applies. A step present in
one and missing from the other is a control that fires for some users and not others. The bodies
are deliberately not byte-identical, since invocation syntax differs per host, so what is asserted
is the contract and its ordering.

Scoped to the agents a project actually wires, per `tests/agent_roster.py` (#690).
