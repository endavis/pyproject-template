# `deadline=None` rather than a larger number (#736). These are property tests
# over string validation — they assert what a value *is*, never how long it took,
# and `benchmark.yml` covers timing separately. A wall-clock budget on a shared
# runner only adds a way for them to fail for reasons unrelated to the property.
#
# Windows runners were seen taking 1506ms on an example's first call and 0.01ms
# on the retry: interpreter and import warmup, not the code under test. The
# earlier 200ms -> 500ms relaxation did not survive that, and any finite
# replacement is a threshold a bad runner can still cross.
#
# Note that `suppress_health_check=[HealthCheck.too_slow]` does *not* cover this.
# The health check and the per-example deadline are separate mechanisms, which is
# why the profile looked protected against slow runners while still failing on
# them.

# coverage difference that turned out to be exactly this.

# handful of commands the code under test invokes with fixed output matching an
# unauthenticated CI runner, and exits 127 with a loud marker for anything else —
# so a new unmocked call fails visibly rather than depending on the machine.
#
# Tests needing specific `gh` behaviour prepend their own stub ahead of this one
# (see tests/test_statusline_gh_user.py::_stub_gh), which still works. Tests of
# Python code that shells out should mock `subprocess.run` instead; this fixture
# is the backstop for what slips through, and for shell scripts under test, which
# cannot be mocked at the Python level.
