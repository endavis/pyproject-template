"""Third-party actions must be pinned to commit SHAs, not mutable tags (#695).

A major tag like `@v7` is a moving pointer the publisher can re-aim at any
commit, so `uses: some/action@v7` is a standing instruction to run whatever that
publisher decides to put there. A 40-character SHA is not re-pointable.

Dependabot is configured for the `github-actions` ecosystem, so pins get bumped
rather than rotting — pinning trades "silently changes" for "changes via a
reviewable PR", which is the whole point.

Each pin carries a `# vX.Y.Z` comment so a human can read the file without
resolving SHAs, and that comment is asserted too: a pin whose comment has drifted
from the version it names is worse than no comment.
