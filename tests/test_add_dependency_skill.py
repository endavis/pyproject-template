"""The two `add-dependency` bodies must agree, and neither may run `uv add`.

Adding a dependency crosses more gates than any other routine task: the Ask
First policy, a hook that blocks `uv add` for every agent, three placement
tables, mypy's missing-import rule, and the supply-chain checks (#829). Without
a skill, an agent that needs a package mid-task hits the hook and asks the user
to run `uv add x` with none of the rest done.

Two surfaces carry it -- `.claude/commands/` for Claude, `.agents/skills/` for
Codex, Antigravity and Copilot -- and whichever agent the user drives decides
which body applies. A step present in one and missing from the other is a
control that fires for some users and not others. The bodies are deliberately
not byte-identical, since invocation syntax differs per host, so what is
asserted is the contract and its ordering.

Scoped to the agents a project actually wires, per `tests/agent_roster.py`
(#690).
