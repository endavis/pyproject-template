"""`AGENTS.md` carries only what every agent needs at all times.

`### AI Config Directories` was 5,847 bytes — 21% of the file — describing four
agents' config layouts to all four agents (#750). Claude parsed Codex's approval
flags and Antigravity's stdout-deny hook contract every session and could act on
neither, and every distinctive fact in the section was already stated in a doc the
section itself linked.

The section is now a pointer table. These tests are the ratchet that keeps it one:

1. Per-agent config *detail* must not reappear anywhere in `AGENTS.md`. Config
   *roots* are shared navigation and stay; the flags, filenames and hook contracts
   behind them belong to one agent and go in that agent's doc.
2. The table's rows stay one line each, so prose cannot creep back into a cell.
3. The table has one row per agent the project actually wires, so a downstream
   that drops an agent is not held to a row it deleted (#690).

A byte budget was considered and rejected (ADR-9018): a size assertion is satisfied
equally by removing agent-specific content — the goal — or by deleting a shared
always-on rule, which is the opposite, so it cannot fail for the right reason.
