"""Tests for the branch/commit issue-reference hook (#741).

Derived from a real failure: during the template review backlog, work for #695
was committed onto `feat/694-download-integrity-verification` — the branch left
over from the previous issue. `no-commit-to-main` passed (not `main`), the
branch-naming hook passed (well-formed), and every quality gate passed (the code
was fine). Only its location was wrong.

The replay of that exact case is `test_the_incident_that_motivated_this_hook`.
