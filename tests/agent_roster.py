"""Which AI agents this project actually ships.

The template wires four agents (Claude, Codex, Copilot, Antigravity). A project
spawned from it may keep only some — most keep one. Tests that assert on agent
wiring used to hardcode the template's own four and assert every file exists,
so dropping an unused agent produced 56 failures on the project's first run
(#690).

These helpers let those tests derive the roster from what is on disk. A project
that keeps every agent sees exactly the same assertions as before; one that
drops an agent simply stops asserting about it.

Presence is keyed on each agent's *self-action skill directory* rather than its
config root, because `.agents/` is shared: both Codex and Antigravity read it,
so its existence cannot distinguish them.

Not a test module — pytest does not collect it (the filename does not match
``test_*.py``).
