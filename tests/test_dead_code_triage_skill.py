"""The two `dead-code-triage` bodies must agree on how a vulture finding is triaged.

`doit check` runs `doit deadcode` as one of its `task_dep` (`tools/doit/quality.py`), so a
vulture finding blocks the check for every agent. Vulture cannot tell a genuine dead import
from one an interface, a framework, or the type checker still needs, so an agent that "fixes"
every finding by deleting or blanket-whitelisting it breaks real code or hides a real bug (#835).

Two surfaces carry the triage steps -- `.claude/commands/` for Claude, `.agents/skills/` for
Codex, Antigravity and Copilot -- and whichever agent the user drives decides which body applies.
A step present in one and missing from the other is a control that fires for some users and not
others. The bodies are deliberately not byte-identical, since invocation syntax differs per host,
so what is asserted is the contract and its ordering.

Scoped to the agents a project actually wires, per `tests/agent_roster.py` (#690).
