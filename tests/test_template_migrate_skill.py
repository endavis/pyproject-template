"""The two `template-migrate` bodies must agree, and must stay standalone.

`template-migrate` is unlike every other workflow file here: it runs in a
repository that does not have this template. No `doit`, no
`tools/pyproject_template/`, no `AGENTS.md`, no `docs/`. An instruction that
reads a template document from local disk resolves to nothing there, and the
agent either invents the content or gives up -- neither of which the user sees
as a failure. `test_no_body_reads_template_docs_from_disk` is the guard for
that, and it is the reason this module exists separately from
`test_template_sync_skill.py`.

The rest follows the same reasoning as that module: two surfaces, whichever
agent the user drives decides which body applies, so a step present in one and
missing from the other is a control that fires for some users and not others.
The bodies are deliberately not byte-identical -- invocation syntax differs per
host -- so what is asserted is the contract and its ordering.

Scoped to the agents a project actually wires, per `tests/agent_roster.py`
(#690).
