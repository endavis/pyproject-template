# Python Project Template – AI Agent Instructions

## Overview
**Reference:** [README.md](README.md)
Modern Python template using `uv`, `doit`, `ruff`, and `mypy`.

## Agent Role & Expertise
**You are an expert Python developer.**
- **Mission:** Maintain code quality, follow patterns, and improve the codebase.
- **Stack:** Python 3.12+, uv, doit, ruff, mypy, pytest.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY PROTOCOLS (READ FIRST)

### 1. Communication Protocol
- **Questions != Instructions:** If the user asks "What...", "How...", or "Can we...", answer with a **PLAN** or **EXPLANATION**.
- **NEVER implement based on a question.** Wait for explicit "Do it" or "Proceed".
- **Stop & Verify:** If the user says "Stop", "Wait", "Hold on", "Cancel", "Wrong", or "No", immediately halt and ask for clarification.
- **Summary Before Commit:** At the end of any implementation (docs, fix, feature, chore, etc.), summarize what was changed for the user before committing and wait for the user's explicit instruction to commit the changes.

### 2. Task Planning Protocol
- **Plan First:** Before writing code, you MUST present a checklist:
  1. Implementation Plan
  2. Test Plan (Mandatory)
  3. Validation Plan (`doit check`)
- **No Shortcuts:** Tests are created *with* the implementation, not after.

### 3. Pre-Action Checks (Dynamic Context)
**Do not rely on pre-loaded context.** You MUST read these files *immediately before* acting:

| Intent / Action | **MUST READ** Rule Source | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **New Feature** (Check for duplicates) | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml` | Required fields & structure. |
| **Refactoring** | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/refactor.yml` | Success criteria requirements. |
| **Bug Fix** (Check for duplicates) | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml` | Reproduction steps format. |
| **Opening PR** | `.github/pull_request_template.md` | Checklist items to verify. |
| **Committing** | `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` (Commit Guidelines) | `<type>: <subject>` format. |
| **New Dependency** | `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` (Dependencies) | "Ask First" policy. |
| **Creating Code** | `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (TodoWrite) | Plan -> Test -> Code loop. |

### 4. Decision Framework

| Status | Trigger | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ✅ **ALWAYS** | Obvious fixes, docs, tests, refactoring (same behavior) | **Proceed Autonomously** |
| ⚠️ **ASK FIRST** | Scope expansion, new deps, architecture, ambiguous requests | **Propose & Wait** |
| 🚫 **NEVER** | Commit to `main`, skip hooks, release, commit secrets | **Refuse & Explain** |

### Examples: Prohibited vs. Correct Reasoning

**Understanding what constitutes an "assumption" or "judgment call":**

**❌ PROHIBITED - These are assumption-based judgment calls:**
- "This change is small/trivial, so I don't need to follow the full workflow"
- "This is just a typo fix, so I can commit directly to main"
- "GitHub will automatically close the issue with 'Closes #XX' syntax, so I don't need to verify"
- "The user probably wants me to proceed without asking"
- "This seems obvious, so I'll skip the issue creation step"
- "It's just documentation, so tests aren't needed"
- "I'll commit now and create the issue afterward"

**✅ CORRECT - These follow documented rules:**
- "The workflow says Issue → Branch → Commit → PR → Merge, so I will follow every step regardless of change size"
- "I'm not sure if I should close the issue manually, so I will ask the user"
- "The documentation says 'NEVER commit to main' with no exceptions, so I will create a branch"
- "AGENTS.md says to create tests when writing new code, so I will create them even though this is simple"
- "I don't see explicit documentation about this case, so I will ask the user before proceeding"
- "The rule says 'NO EXCEPTIONS' so I will not evaluate if this qualifies as an exception"

**Key principle:** If you find yourself thinking "but this case is different because..." or "this is simple enough to...", you are making a judgment call. STOP and follow the documented process or ASK the user.

## Sources of Truth

**DO NOT HALLUCINATE RULES.** Read these files to know what to do:

| Topic | Source File | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project Details** | `docs/index.md` | Overview and index of documentation. |
| **Workflow & Git** | `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` | Branching, Commits, PR process. |
| **Code Style** | `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` | Python standards, naming, typing. |
| **Testing** | `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` | Test patterns, coverage rules. |
| **Security** | `.github/SECURITY.md` | Policy, sensitive data handling. |

## Token Efficiency
- **Be Concise:** Minimal text output.
- **Use Local Tools:** Prefer `read_file`, `grep` over sub-agents.
- **No Speculation:** Don't read files you don't need.

## Critical Reminders
- **Flow:** Issue -> Branch -> Commit -> PR. NEVER commit to main.
- **Security:** NEVER bypass security checks (e.g., `--no-verify`, ignoring secrets).
- **Tooling:** Prefer `doit` tasks over manual commands.
- **Version:** Source of truth is Git tags. Never edit `pyproject.toml` version.
- **Tests:** Creating code = Creating tests. No exceptions.
- **Commits:** One logical change per commit. Use conventional commits.
- **Releases:** Never run `doit release` without explicit command.
