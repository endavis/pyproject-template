# Review PR

Run a single-agent PR review using Antigravity in this repository.

## When to use

Use this skill when the user wants Antigravity to review the current branch's pull request.

Antigravity activates this skill by matching your request against this description, so phrase the request naturally — there is no slash or `$` prefix.

Expected prompt shape:

- `review the current PR`
- `review this branch's pull request`

The user may include optional focus text.

## Instructions

1. Verify a PR exists for the current branch:
   ```bash
   gh pr view --json number,title,body,headRefName
   ```
   - If no PR exists, stop and tell the user.
   - Save the PR number for later.

2. Gather review context:
   ```bash
   gh pr diff
   git log main..HEAD --oneline
   ```
   - Read `AGENTS.md` and `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`.
   - Check for relevant ADRs in `docs/decisions/`.

3. Review the changes for:
   - **Correctness:** does the code do what it claims? Are there logic errors?
   - **Code style:** does it follow existing patterns and conventions?
   - **Testing:** are tests present and adequate? Are edge cases covered?
   - **Security:** any injection, path traversal, secrets, or command-injection risks?
   - **Documentation:** are public APIs, config changes, or breaking changes documented?
   - **Architecture:** does it respect layering rules?
   - **Breaking changes:** any signature changes, removed APIs, or behavior changes?

4. Format findings as:
   ```markdown
   ## PR Review: #<number> — <title>

   ### Summary
   One-paragraph overview.

   ### Findings

   #### Critical
   - (blocking issues)

   #### Suggestions
   - (non-blocking improvements)

   #### Positive
   - (things done well)

   ### Verdict
   **Approve / Request Changes / Comment** — justification.

   ```

5. Present the review to the user and ask whether to post it as a PR comment.

6. If the user approves, post:
   ```bash
   gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "<review>"
   ```
