# Snapshot

Capture a resumption prompt for picking up the current work later.

## When to use

Use this skill when the user wants to pause the current Codex session and leave a paste-ready prompt that any agent (Codex, Claude, or Gemini) can pick up later. This is the **save** side of the snapshot/resume pair — `$resume` is the load side.

Expected prompt shape:

- `$snapshot snapshot this work as plan-test`
- `$snapshot capture a resumption prompt for the current branch`

The user supplies an optional kebab-case `<slug>` describing the topic. If the slug is missing, infer a 3-5 word descriptive slug from the conversation context.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Compute the filename

Filename format: `{inv_epoch}-<slug>.md` in `tmp/resume/`.

`inv_epoch` is a 10-digit integer that *decreases* as time advances, so default `ls` (no flags) lists newest entries first. Compute:

```bash
INV_EPOCH=$(printf '%010d' $((9999999999 - $(date +%s))))
```

(The prefix is for sort order only; users read the slug and file contents, not the number.)

Run `mkdir -p tmp/resume` before writing. Don't overwrite existing files; if a same-named file exists, append a 1-letter discriminator (`-a`, `-b`, …) to the slug.

> Note: this directory deviates from the `tmp/agents/<agent-type>/` convention in `AGENTS.md`. `tmp/resume/` is intentionally shared (not per-agent) so snapshots are portable across agents — Codex can write a snapshot and Claude or Gemini can resume from it.

### Step 2: Draft the prompt

The prompt must be **paste-ready** — readable cold by a future agent session that has zero context from this conversation. Use absolute references throughout: issue/PR numbers, file paths, ISO dates (no "yesterday"/"this morning").

Structure:

- **Title** — short description of what's deferred.
- **Paste-block intro** — one line telling the future user what to do (paste into a fresh agent session at the repo's working directory).
- **Status as of {today's ISO date}** — what landed recently (merged PRs and closed issues with brief descriptions), current branch state, anything in-flight.
- **Open issues** (if any are filed but not started) — number, title, one-line scope.
- **Goal** — the bigger-picture objective this work serves.
- **Pick: option N (the recommendation)** — list 2-3 numbered next-step options. Mark the recommendation. Brief tradeoff notes.
- **User direction recorded** — decisions, preferences, or constraints surfaced in the current conversation that future sessions need to honor (e.g., "no cross-provider X", "always prefer Y pattern").
- **Pre-action reads** — files/docs the future session should read before starting, scoped per option.
- **Workflow** — short reminder of project conventions (Issue → Branch → PR per `AGENTS.md`, etc.).
- **Start by:** — concrete first command (e.g., `$plan-issue 714`, or `git checkout main && git pull`).

Add anything else load-bearing — open blockers, runtime gotchas, manual prerequisite steps. Keep tight; this is a paste-block, not a doc.

Don't dump conversation history. Don't include local-environment ephemera. Don't restate auto-loaded context files.

### Step 3: Confirm to the user

Report:
- The full path to the created file.
- A one-line summary of what's captured.
- The quick-use reminder: "paste the file contents into a fresh agent session at this repo's root."

## Notes

- Files persist; no auto-cleanup. The user can `rm` old prompts manually when they're stale.
- If invoked multiple times in one session, write a new file each time. The user may want separate resumption-points for separate work threads.
- The prefix uses 10 digits because epoch will exceed 10 digits in the year 2286; that's fine for foreseeable use. If you ever need to extend, bump to 11+ digits.
- The companion `$resume` skill loads a captured snapshot in a future session — point users to it.
