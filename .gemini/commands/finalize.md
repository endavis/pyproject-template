# Finalize (Gemini)

Finalize the current branch: update documentation, commit changes, and create a PR.

## Instructions

This command operates on the current branch. It assumes implementation and review are complete.

### Step 1: Gather context

1. **Detect the current branch and linked issue:**
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```
   Extract the issue number from the branch name (e.g., `feat/245-description` → `#245`).
   - If on `main`, tell the user they need to be on a feature branch and stop.

2. **Get the issue details:**
   ```bash
   gh issue view <number> --json title,labels
   ```

3. **Check for uncommitted changes:**
   ```bash
   git status --short
   ```
   - If there are unstaged or uncommitted changes, list them for the user.
   - These will be included in the commit — confirm with the user that all changes should be included.

4. **Check what changed vs main:**
   ```bash
   git diff main --stat
   ```

### Step 2: Finalization

Execute the finalization steps directly in the current context:

1. **Read the project rules:**
   - Read `AGENTS.md` — understand commit guidelines, PR checklist, ADR requirements.
   - Read `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` — understand commit format.
   - Read `.github/pull_request_template.md` — understand PR structure.

2. **Check documentation needs:**
   - Review the changed files — do any user-facing behaviors change?
   - If yes, identify which docs in `docs/` need updating and update them.
   - Check `docs/decisions/` for related ADRs that need updating.

3. **Check ADR needs:**
   - If the issue has the `needs-adr` label, create an ADR using `doit adr`.
   - If the changes relate to an existing ADR, update it with the issue link.
   - Every ADR must link to documentation in `docs/`.

4. **Run final validation:**
   - Run: `doit check`
   - ALL checks must pass before proceeding.

5. **Draft the PR description:**
   - Read `.github/pull_request_template.md` for structure.
   - Run `mkdir -p tmp/agents/gemini` to ensure the directory exists.
   - Write the PR body to `tmp/agents/gemini/pr-body-issue-<n>.md`.
   - The body MUST include `Addresses #<issue-number>`.

### Step 3: Commit and create PR

1. **Show the user:**
   - Documentation changes made (if any)
   - ADR changes made (if any)
   - Suggested commit message following conventional format: `<type>: <subject>`
   - Suggested PR title following conventional format: `<type>: <subject>`
   - Path to the PR body file (`tmp/agents/gemini/pr-body-issue-<n>.md`)

2. **Ask the user for approval** to commit and create the PR.

3. **Only after user confirms:**
   - Stage files: `git add <specific files>` (include all changed files).
   - Commit with the approved message.
   - Create PR: `doit pr --title="<type>: <subject>" --body-file=tmp/agents/gemini/pr-body-issue-<n>.md`
   - Delete the temp file: `rm tmp/agents/gemini/pr-body-issue-<n>.md`

4. **Report the PR URL to the user.**

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT commit or create the PR without explicit user confirmation.
